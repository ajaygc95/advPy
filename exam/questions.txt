1. Write a Temperature class to hold the data, partially listed below (see question 3), in a named tuple.
 The class should contain a constructor and a Python standard string conversion function to convert a
 Temperature class object to a string.

2. Using your SQLite class, write a member function to support [square brackets] which returns the median data for a given year.
 For example:

 temperatureObject = Temperature()
 temperatureObject[ 2017 ] = 123

3. Write a Named Tuple to hold the data in the Temperature.csv (partially listed below).

4. Using your Database class from Lab1, take the function outlined in Question3 and store the DataFrame data
in your Sqlite Database. Assume the database has already been constructed and the Table initialized.


5.Plot the data in your sqlite database from Question 4 using MatPlotLib.
